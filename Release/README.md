## RTAutoSprint, Rewritten From The Ground Up

---

It works for all skills, no more hardcoding which one does what. Works for Seekers of the Storm and every character ever.

Except for the fact that it doesn't. Because of course there's special cases. Report bugs to the github issues page.

## *Now Includes Configurable FOV Changes!*

---

### **Force Sprinting FOV**
  - Default: **ENABLED**
  - Forces the camera to always use the sprint FOV for the nice 1.3x boost


### **Disable Sprinting FOV Increase**
  - Default: **DISABLED**
  - Camera ignores sprinting state to keep the original 60 FOV
  - This setting does nothing if Force Sprinting FOV is enabled!!

Disable both config options to return to vanilla behavior.

---

### The config provides everything you need to fix it yourself

---

- Disable bodies
- Disable entity states
- disable entity states for a fixed duration
- disable entity states for a duration found in a field within the state
- Has a debug setting to help finding names of things
- You can find me in the modding discord if you need help, it's complex I know.
